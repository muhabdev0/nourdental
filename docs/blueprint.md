## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft medical blue (#77B5FE), inspired by a sense of trust, calm, and hygiene. This primary color can also work as teal.
- Background color: Off-white (#F9F9F9), very desaturated hue of soft medical blue (around 20% saturation) for a clean, calming backdrop in a light scheme.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#C0B283), a slightly darker hue than the primary, and 30 degrees to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel. It's less saturated than the primary, offering contrast without overwhelming the design.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif font for elegance. Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, since Playfair is only suitable for small chunks of text.
- Use custom-designed icons in a light green or gold to represent dental services, appointment booking, and contact information.
- Employ a clean, modern layout with generous white space and rounded corners to create a calming and trustworthy environment.
- Implement subtle hover animations on buttons and interactive elements to enhance user engagement and provide feedback.
